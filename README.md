# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To make the project work just run `yarn` to install all dependencies and the `yarn start` to run the project locally.

Content rendered through the project is based on a wp api (https://people.canonical.com/~anthonydillon/wp-json/wp/v2/posts.json)
